# Music-Recommendation-System
The project focused on building a music recommendation system using machine learning, specifically employing a content-based filtering approach. In this system, features of each song—such as genre, artist, and lyrics—are transformed into numerical vectors through a process called vectorization. To identify similar songs, the system uses cosine similarity, a technique that measures the angle between two vectors to assess their similarity, regardless of their scale. By comparing these vectorized song attributes, the system delivers personalized recommendations aligned with a user's musical preferences. Unlike systems that depend on user activity or external ratings, this approach generates suggestions based solely on the intrinsic characteristics of the music, resulting in a more personalized and effective recommendation engine.

The deployment was carried out using PyCharm, a robust IDE for managing Python projects, and Streamlit, a framework designed for building interactive web applications with ease. Streamlit enabled the integration of the machine learning model into a web-based user interface, allowing users to input their preferences and receive instant music recommendations. Its simplicity and flexibility helped bridge the backend ML logic with a functional, intuitive frontend, making the system accessible and user-friendly.
